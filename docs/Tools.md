# Some Useful Softwares

## What tools do I actually need, right now?

That looks like a scary list, but fortunately, you can get started in web development without knowing anything about most of these. In this article, we'll just set you up with a bare minimum â€” a text editor and some modern web browsers.

### Installing a text editor

You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit. Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.

For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting out with Brackets, which is a free editor that offers live previews and code hints.

### Installing modern web browsers

For now, we'll just install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click the relevant links to download installers for your favorite browsers:

* Linux: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).
* Windows: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (Windows 10 comes with Edge by default; if you have Windows 7 or above, you can install Internet Explorer 11; otherwise, you should install an alternative browser)
* Mac: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (Safari comes with iOS and macOS by default)

Before going on, you should install at least two of these browsers and have them ready for testing.

### Installing a local web server

Some examples will need to be run by a web server to work successfully. You can find out how to do this in [How do you set up a local testing server?](../docs/Setup-Web-Server.html)
