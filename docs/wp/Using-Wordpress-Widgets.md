## Using WordPress Widgets 

WordPress Widgets add additional content and features to your WordPress site. Examples of widgets are search bars, a list of post categories or tags, and custom menus 
 
 One of the great things about WordPress widgets is that they require no code experience or expertise. Thanks to WordPress, they can simply be added, removed and rearranged. 

The actual location of widgets on your site depends on your WordPress theme. Most WordPress themes offer several different page templates that decide where widget locations are in the page design, such as in the sidebar of your blog, or at the bottom of your home page. 

In addition to the default WordPress widgets, WordPress plugins often add their own widgets as well. Some may add additional options for customization features. 

To see how widgets work, log in to your WordPress site and visit the **Appearance > Widgets** panel. On the left side of the page, you’ll see all available widgets. Default widgets will be visible here, plus any additional widgets that have been added by your installed plugins. On the right, you’ll see all of your available widget locations. 

To add a widget to a location, simply drag the widget from its place on the left into the right section to activate them. To remove them, simply drag the widget back or click delete. 

If you ever have questions or need help using widgets, just click the help tab from the top of the screen.

Here you’ll find an overview, information on removing and reusing widgets and how to handle missing widgets if you change your WordPress theme. 

## Creating a Custom Menu in WordPress
 
With WordPress, you can easily create a custom menu, which usually serves as a navigation menu for your site. 
Watch the video: 

Custom menus in WordPress may contain links to pages, categories, custom links or other content types. You can also specify a different navigation label for a menu item as well as assign other attributes. 

There’s no limit on how many menus you can create, so if your theme includes more than one menu location, you can choose which custom menu to associate with each location. You can also use custom menus in conjunction with the Custom Menus widget. 

How to Create a Custom Menu in WordPress 

1. To get started creating a custom menu, log in to your WordPress site and click to expand the **Appearance** menu on the left side of the WordPress Dashboard. 

2. Click on the **Menus** link in the **Appearance** menu. You’ll now see the Menus editor page. 

3. Enter your menu name, and click **Create menu**. 

4. Now you’re ready to **add menu items** from the boxes on the left, such as pages, categories and links. 

5. If you’d like to change which menu options you see from this page, click to expand the **Screen Options** tab. Now you can add other menu items options such as posts, tags or formats, or show advanced menu properties like CSS classes. 

6. When you have your menu items arranged in order, click **Save Menu**. You now have a new navigation menu that can be added to any menu location on your WordPress site. 

## Managing Comments in WordPress 
With WordPress, visitors can leave comments on posts and pages. 
  
One of the greatest things about blogs is the ability to let readers comment. One of the worst things about blogs is the ability to let readers comment. 

Running a website with public comments can be extremely rewarding and, at times, frustrating. Giving your readers a forum to voice their opinion can refine your work, help you discover new perspectives and even give you a much-needed pat on the back. Giving your readers that opportunity can also open you up to a world of headaches, spam and endless arguments. 

But most bloggers will tell you that despite the drawbacks, comments are worth it in the end: 

- By giving your readers a voice you’re showing them how valuable they are to you. That kind of loyalty means a lot. 

- Let’s face it: You don’t know everything. Nobody does. Having comments is a subtle way to admit that you’re not perfect and allow your readers to help you out. And they will. It will make your writing stronger and your site better. 

- Often the contributions of comments will outweigh the value of the original post. Sometimes great ideas will be shared, links offered or massive discussions that go far deeper than you could have dreamed. And it’s all on your site. That’s gold. 

- It can build community. When people have a “voice” on your blog, they feel valued and that what they say makes a difference. 

In the end, whether or not to have comments is an important choice and one you shouldn’t take lightly. You need to weigh the pros and cons. You need to decide if open comments fit your company’s style. For some organizations it’s a perfect fit. For others—it’s awkward. 

If you’re undecided about comments, there is good news. There are a lot of halfway solutions. 

You’re also welcome to change your mind and turn comments on or off at will (of course if you turn comments on after they’ve been off for a while you’ve already missed out on the best input from your readers). But whatever you decide, it’s best to pick a solution and stick to it. Your readers will get confused if commenting is inconsistent on your site. 

### Commenting Policy 

Once you’ve decided to have comments, it’s important to have a commenting policy in place. It doesn’t necessarily have to be public, but you might consider it. What’s important is to know how you’re going to respond to a specific situation and enforce your rules consistently. 

- Are commenters allowed to use profanity? Where do you draw the line? 

- It’s easy for a comment thread to get off topic. Is that OK or do you want comments to only pertain to your post? 

- Discussions often turn into debates, which turn into flat-out arguments. Do you step in to restore order? Or let people duke it out? 

- What do you do when someone disagrees with you or your company? What if that means they recommend competitors? 

- What happens when someone ignores your rules? 

You may not run into any of these comment issues. But it helps to be prepared. Often the style of your organization will help you determine your comment policy. A loose, care free organization might encourage people to disagree. A strict, top-down company might ban any discussion of competing products. It’s your website—you set the tone. 
Here’s another thing you’ll need to decide: how active are you going to be in your own comments? Some people like to be very active, encouraging responses and interacting with readers. That can also be time-demanding, but may also benefit your business. Other people may only step in when it’s absolutely necessary, letting their readers have their own discussion. 
 
## Managing Comments in WordPress: The Comments Page 

Managing comments in WordPress is quite similar to the way posts and pages are managed. From the WordPress dashboard, visit the **Comments page**. 

A yellow row means the comment is waiting for you to moderate it. You can act on comments using the **on- hover action** links or **the Bulk Actions**. 

In the **Author column**, in addition to the author’s name, email address, and blog URL, the commenter’s IP address is shown. Clicking on this link will show you all the comments made from this IP address. 

In the **Comment column**, each comment includes Submitted on information, followed by the date and time the comment was left on your site. Clicking the date/time link will take you to that comment on your live site. Hovering over any comment gives you options to approve, reply (and approve), quick edit, edit, spam mark, or trash that comment. 

In the **In Response To** column, there are three elements. The text is the name of the post that comment is assigned to, and links to the post editor for that entry. 

The **View Post** link leads back to that post on your live site. This small bubble with the number shows the number of approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to show only comments on that post. 

## Managing Comments from the Dashboard Home Screen 

Another way to manage comments is from the **WordPress dashboard home screen**. Here you’ll see recent comments and you can quickly and easily approve, reply, edit, mark as spam or trash by hovering over these links. 

## WordPress Comment Settings
 
Don’t forget you can change your Comment
or **Discussion settings** from within the WordPress settings menu. This page allows you to make changes to the details of comments made on your site, plus the ability to blacklist comments to help manage spam comments.
