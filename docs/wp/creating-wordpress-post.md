expand it to reveal the submenu.

Watch the video:

# Creating a WordPress Post
 
 The **Add New Posts page** can also be found from the **+ New link** in the WordPress Admin Bar.

Click the **Add New** link.

Now you’ll see the Add New Post page where you can
create your first post.

The first box is where you’ll want to enter the title of your post.

Next is the post formatting section or post editor. This is where you’ll actually type the content of your post.

If you look on the right side of the box, you’ll see two tabs. There are two modes of editing posts: Visual and Text.

The Visual tab will bring up the visual WYSIWYG editor. WYSIWYG just means “what you see is what you get.” Here you’ll see a formatting toolbar with lots of options for formatting your posts. If you’re familiar with Microsoft Word or any other word processing software, most of these icons should look familiar.

If you click the Text tab, this will reveal a plain-text HTML version of the post editor. This version of the post editor is for editing the HTML code of your post. For most users, the Visual editor is the easiest way to write posts.


 At the top of the right column on this screen you’ll see the Publish box. Here, your can save your post as a draft if you’d like to save it for later. If you click the Preview button, you can get a preview of how the post will look once it’s published.

The Status of the post will show if the post has been published, saved as a draft, if it’s pending review or if it has been scheduled.

The next two links show the visibility of the post — or what visitors will be able to see your post. The Publish line shows whether the post will be published immediately or at a later date.

The next section are for categories and tags assigned to your WordPress post. We’ll cover these two topics in more detail later.

If you’d like to change the screen options for your post editor, just click the screen options tab in the upper right hand corner. Expand this to reveal all the options that can be displayed on the post editor screen.

Again from the post editor, you can also drag or drop the order of these boxes to customize how you want them arranged on the page.

 If you ever need help while you’re on the Add New Posts page, just click the Help tab in the upper right corner. From here, you’ll be able to get a reminder for how to customize your post display, tips for adding a post title and using the post editor, inserting media and settings for publishing and discussion.

## Adding Links in WordPress
The WordPress post and page editor makes it easy to add hyperlinks to other web pages from your content.

Watch the video:

1. From the WordPress post or page editor, select the text that you want to be hyperlinked.
2. Once you have that text selected, click the hyperlink button in the toolbar.
3. This will bring up a box where you can enter the URL of your hyperlink and a title to be displayed on hover. You can also click this checkbox to open the link in a new tab.
4. If you’d rather link to existing content on your website, just click to expand this section. Now you’ll see a search bar to search your site and a list of existing posts or pages. Clicking on one of the items in the list will change the hyperlink URL above.
5. Once you have your hyperlink URL ready to go, click the Add Link button. Now your selected text will have a link.
6. To remove the link, select your text again and click the unlink button. Now you’ll see that your link has been removed.
 
## Adding Images to Posts & Pages

using a visual element like an image
 or photo is a great way to spruce up
 your post or page content.
 Watch the video:

 ### Adding Images in WordPress
   

 1. Determine where you’d like to insert your image in your post or page. Above the Post editor toolbar, you’ll see an Add Media button. Click the Add Media button and you’ll see the Insert Media box.
2. Your WordPress site uses a media library to store all of your media like images and videos. From this box, you can choose to either upload a new file or use an existing file from the media library. To upload an image, click
the Select files button. Find the image you’d like to use and click open.
3. Now that your image has been uploaded, you’ll see it has been added to the media library. On the right side of this box, you’ll see the attachment details for this page. Here you can change the Title, Caption, Alt
text and Description.
You can also choose the alignment of the image (such as center, left or right), where the inserted image should link to, the actual URL of the image and the size of the image.
4. Make sure the image has a checkbox and click
the Insert into post button. Now you’ll see your image has been added to your post.
5. If you click on this image, you should see two boxes appear in the upper left-hand corner of the image. The first is the image icon. If you click that icon, you’ll now see another box open for editing the details of the image. Here you can change the size of the image based on percentages (which can be a handy tool for resizing) or you can update the title, alternative text, the caption and link URL. You can also select this image to link nowhere, or to link to the actual image file.
6. If you click the advanced settings tab, you’ll see the URL of where the image file is hosted on your site, the actual width and height of the image in pixels, the CSS Class, styles and image properties that add padding around the image.
7. Return to the image in your post. The next icon in the upper left corner will delete the image out of the post. If you click the Add Media button again, you’ll see the same insert media box. On the left side of this box, you’ll see options to create a gallery and set the featured image. Once you have more images in our media library, you’ll be able to add an entire gallery of images into the post.
The featured image of the post is sometimes used by your WordPress theme. Go ahead and choose this image as your featured image and return back to the post editor. Now, you can preview the post and see that our image has been added.


## Using the WordPress Media Library

The WordPress Media Library contains all the files you’ve uploaded to your WordPress site, with the most recent uploads listed first.
 
 Watch the video:

To visit your WordPress Media Library, expand
the Media menu from the WordPress dashboard. The Media Library page will show all of the media items you currently have in your media library.
To add a new media item to your library, click the Add New link. From here, upload a new image. Once your image has been uploaded, you’ll see it has been added to the library.
## Editing Images in the WordPress Media Library

One of the neat features of the WordPress media library is the ability to edit images. Click on an image, and then click the Edit Image button. Now, you can crop, rotate, flip or scale the image.

For example, you can rescale this image and then click the Save button. Now, click the Update button.

WordPress Media Library Multi- File Uploader
If you have more than one file to upload at once, you can easily switch to the multi-file uploader. Now, just drag and drop multiple files here to be added to your WordPress Media Library.

## Formatting WordPress Posts
In this section, we’ll be covering some of the basics of formatting your WordPress posts with the built-in WordPress post editor.

Watch the video:


 The majority of your formatting options can be found in the Post Editor Toolbar. If you’ve ever used a word processing software such as Microsoft Word, most of these icons should look familiar.

To get started formatting your WordPress posts,
visit Posts > Add New or Posts > All Posts and select the post you’d like to edit.

The formatting icons included in the WordPress post editor include:

- In the first row of the toolbar, we have options to bold, italicize or strikethrough text. To bold text, just select the text you’d like to format and click the bold button. You’ll see this text has been bolded.
- The next two icons are for bulleted and numbered lists. If you’d like to add a list to a post, just select the text, then click that icon.
- The quotation mark icon is the block quote feature. By default, this will add an indentation and italicized style to your selected text. (Note: your WordPress theme controls how block quotes are styled on the front end of your site.)
- Next are alignment options. You can choose to align left, center or align right.
- The next icon is the insert more tag. This will change how much text your blog page displays with a read more link.
- If you’d prefer to write your posts in distraction free mode, click this icon. This will take you to full-screen writing mode similar to using a Word processing software. To exit out of this mode, we’ll click “exit fullscreen.”
- If we click the Show/hide the kitchen sink, another line of formatting options will be
revealed. Here you can add heading styles to your text, underline text or set a full alignment.
- If you decide you’d like to change the color of your selected text, just use this icon to select the color.
- The next two icons are for pasting text — either as plain text or from Microsoft Word.
 If you ever get stuck using your formatting icons, you can simply hover over the icon to see the name and function.

# Scheduling WordPress Posts

Scheduling your WordPress posts is an easy way to control when your content is published. With the built-in WordPress post scheduler, you can add a time to publish.
Watch the video:

This WordPress posts scheduling feature is found in
the Publish box on the upper right side of the post editor page.

To schedule a post for publication, click the edit link next to Publish Immediately. You’ll now see a drop-down option to select the month, date and year to publish the post, even the exact hour and minute.
For example, if you’d like to publish this post at 8 a.m. tomorrow, select tomorrow’s date, set the time for 8 a.m., and click Ok. You’ll now see the Schedule button has appeared.

Click the Schedule button and you’ll see the status of this post has changed to scheduled with details for the exact date and time it will be published to your blog.

If you change your mind and want to publish this post immediately, click the Edit link next to the scheduled publish time. Just update the time to today’s date and the current time and this will immediately publish the post.


## WordPress Categories & Tags
WordPress categories and tags are a way to add an organizational structure to your WordPress posts.
Watch the video:

## WordPress Categories
WordPress categories are basic ways for you to organize your posts into different categories, such as topics.

For example, when writing a post, think of the wider topic of the post. If you plan to write more posts about this topic in the future, you’ll probably want to group these posts together.
From the post editor page, find the Categories box.
 ### Adding a New Category

If you don’t have any categories yet, click the + Add new category link. Add a new category and click Add new category. You’ll then see your new category has been added to the list of categories.

To assign a category to a post, click the checkbox next to the category.

Another way to manage post categories is through
the Posts > Categories link in the WordPress dashboard navigation menu. Clicking the Categories link will display the Categories page. From here, you can see all your categories on the right, and where to add new ones.


### Category Slug
The Category Slug is the URL-friendly version of the category. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers and hyphens.

### Category Hierarchies

Categories, unlike tags, can be nested into hierarchies. For example, you might have a Jazz category, and under that have children categories for Bebop and big band.

### Category Description
The description section is a place for you to add more details about the posts assigned to that category. Some WordPress themes may show this information.

## WordPress Categories vs. Tags
What’s the difference between categories and tags? Think of your site like a book. Categories are like the Table of Contents and tags are like the terms in the index.
