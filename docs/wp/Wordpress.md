## Purchasing Your Domain Name
The first thing you need in order to have a website is have a domain name. A domain name is what you type in to a browser window to visit a site, such as http://www.mysite.com. A domain name is how anyone from anywhere in the world can access your site.

If you’ve already registered your domain name, then you’re good to go for the next step—hosting.

 If you haven’t registered a domain name, the easiest way is to do it as you sign up for hosting. But you can also purchase (register) your domain name before you are ready to sign up for a hosting account.

> Note: if you are registering your domain name at GoDaddy, don’t sign up for anything except the domain registration – ignore the hosting offers, etc. that they’ll show you.

What if you’re not sure what domain name you want? You can’t choose between two or three you really like? A good rule of thumb is to register all of them. It’s not that expensive and it gives you some time to decide. 

You’ll want to have solidified your decision before you start promoting your site, but don’t let picking a domain name be a barrier to getting started.

## Setting Up Your Hosting Account

In order for your website to appear on the web, it has to be hosted somewhere. Think of hosting like a storage facility. It’s a place for you to store all of your stuff (your website) on the web. The more stuff you have (the bigger your site) the more storage space you need.

 There are many web hosting companies that offer a wide variety of hosting plans. Just note that with hosting you get what you pay for. Be careful about choosing a cheap shared hosting plan, as many hosting companies overload their servers, which will impact the speed of your own site.

It’s also essential that you work with one that is “WordPress friendly.” While this isn’t an official designation, of course, just something we’ve learned to look for over the years.

## Installing WordPress

The final step is to install WordPress on your server. Most hosting companies offer thorough instructions on installing WordPress or services to install WordPress for you.

Using a quick-install service is a simple way to get your WordPress installation up and running, but the downside is that it does leave some security holes.

For that reason, you may want to consider installing WordPress manually.


## What are the benefits of doing a manual installation?

- It prevents the WordPress database tables being installed as a default, with default labels. These default labels can make your site more vulnerable.
- It allows for full customization of the wp-config.php file, which opens up enormous potential in WordPress.
- It allows you to work within the “best security practices” for your WordPress site.
