## What are WordPress Plugins? 

WordPress plugins are bits of software that can be uploaded to extend and expand the functionality of your WordPress site. 

> Note: One of the primary advantages of using the self-hosted version of WordPress from WordPress.org is the ability to upload and use plugins on your WordPress site. 

Since WordPress is open source software, these are all third party tools that add-on to what WordPress can do. 

They’re easy to download and install. Some are premium (there is a fee to purchase them) and others are free. Plugins can do things like improve your search engine optimization, display related posts in your sidebar, do complete backups of your WordPress site (BackupBuddy) or create stunning web forms quickly and easily (Gravity Forms). 

You can add just about any functionality to WordPress with plugins. The WordPress Plugin Directory is a repository of free plugins that have been (somewhat) vetted. There are currently more than 40,000 plugins in the WordPress directory, so there are a lot of options. 

## Free vs. Premium WordPress Plugins 

As we just mentioned, there are tons of WordPress plugins available for free download from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. 

There are also premium or paid WordPress plugins. 
 
Why would you want to pay for a plugin? Well, there are several reasons: 

- While there are thousands of plugins available for free from the plugin directory, paid plugins usually offer a full time support staff and developers that work on maintaining the security and compatibility of plugins with the latest version of WordPress, as well as with other themes and plugins. 

- Most of the time, plugins play nicely with the core of WordPress and with other plugins, but sometimes a plugin’s code will get in the way of another plugin, causing compatibility issues. With a paid plugin, it’s just nice to know you have support staff that can help you out if anything goes wrong. 
 

## Installing WordPress Plugins 

Installing plugins on your WordPress site is a simple process. 

### Download & Upload Method
 
> Note: If you’re using premium plugins from a third party source, they will usually come as a .zip file. You’ll need to use the download & upload method to install the plugin zip file on your site. 

1. To install a plugin on your WordPress site, locate the Plugins menu after logging in to your site’s WordPress dashboard. Expand this menu. 

2. To upload a new plugin, click the Add New link. 

3. Click the Upload Plugin button, locate your plugin zip file and then click Install Now. Then, click Activate. 
The first plugin we recommend uploading is BackupBuddy, a premium plugin developed by our team at iThemes. BackupBuddy backs up your entire WordPress site’s installation, so you’ll always have a backup plan if your site crashes, is hacked or if you mess something up and need to go back in time to an earlier version of the site. 

### Search & Install Method 

You also have the option to search for plugins to install from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, directly from the Add New page. Click the tabs on this page to see featured, popular, newest and plugins you’ve marked as favorites. 

1. Use the search bar to search for the plugin of your choice. 

2. Click the Install Now button.

3. Once the plugin is installed, just click Activate. 

### Manual Installation Method 

You can also add plugins manually by uploading them with FTP software. This is more complicated and not for the novice user. You’ll need to download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it. This will give you a folder on your computer with all the plugin files. Then, using an FTP program, upload the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins folder on your site. Then go to the Plugins screen and you can find your new plugin in the list. Click **‘Activate’** to get started. 

## More Plugins Menu Options
 
On the Installed Plugins page, you’ll also see a list of all the plugins currently installed on your WordPress site. Some plugins come bundled with your WordPress installation, like Akismet, a plugin that protects your blog from comment and trackback spam, and Jetpack, a way to connect your blog to a WordPress.com account and activate additional features.

The last menu item beneath Plugins in the WordPress dashboard is the Editor. The built-in WordPress plugin editor can be used to make changes to any of your plugins’ individual PHP files. Just be aware that if you make changes, plugin updates will overwrite your customizations. So, unless you know PHP, you probably won’t want to edit any of your plugin’s PHP code.
