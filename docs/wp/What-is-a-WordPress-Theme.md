##What is a WordPress Theme? 

A WordPress theme provides all of the front end styling of your WordPress site. 
 
WordPress uses themes to control the look and presentation of your site. You can quickly change themes and change the entire look of your site, while still maintaining the underlying WordPress software that powers your site. 

WordPress themes are kind of like how a new outfit can give you an entirely new look. But themes go even deeper than just the design. They control the layout and functionality of your site as well. You can create different layouts for different types of content with a theme. 

It’s part of what makes WordPress so powerful. You can change the entire look of your site without ever changing the content or backend structure. A few clicks of the mouse and you can add a new theme and have an entirely new look. It can make updating your site and keeping things current a much quicker and simpler process. Instead of rebuilding a house from the ground up, you’re just replacing the siding, so to speak. 

Themes come in all types and varieties, including free and premium themes. You can also customize a theme to make it your own. 
 
Most WordPress themes provide: 

- The overall design or style of your site 

- Font styling 

- Colors 

- Widget locations 

- Page layouts (or templates) 

- Styles for blog posts and blog archives 

- Additional stylistic details 

## Free vs. Paid WordPress Themes
 
Just like WordPress plugins, you can choose from over a thousand free themes from the WordPress Theme Directory or invest in premium, or paid themes like our own iThemes Builder. 

The advantages of premium themes are like those of premium plugins. Premium themes usually have a reliable code base and offer support if something goes wrong. 

Some premium themes, like Builder, operate more like web design software, allowing you to design and build your own theme designs and page layouts. 
 
## How to Install a WordPress Theme 

In addition to the default theme included with your WordPress installation, you can also install your own WordPress theme to change the look and style of your site. 

## Download & Upload Method 

> Note: If you’re using premium plugins from a third party source, they will usually come as a .zip file. You’ll need to use the download & upload method to install the plugin zip file on your site. 

1. To install a plugin on your WordPress site, locate the **Plugins** menu after logging in to your site’s WordPress dashboard. Expand this menu. 

2. To upload a new plugin, click the **Add New** link. 

3. Click the **Upload Plugin** button, **locate your plugin zip file** and then click **Install Now**. Then, click **Activate**. 

The first plugin we recommend uploading is BackupBuddy, a premium plugin developed by our team at iThemes. BackupBuddy backs up your entire WordPress site’s installation, so you’ll always have a backup plan if your site crashes, is hacked or if you mess something up and need to go back in time to an earlier version of the site. 

## Search & Install Method 

You also have the option to search for plugins to install from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, directly from the Add New page. Click the tabs on this page to see featured, popular, newest and plugins you’ve marked as favorites. 

1. Use the search bar to search for the plugin of your choice. 

2. Click the **Install Now** button.

3. Once the plugin is installed, just click **Activate**. 

## Manual Installation Method 

You can also add plugins manually by uploading them with FTP software. This is more complicated and not for the novice user. You’ll need to download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it. This will give you a folder on your computer with all the plugin files. Then, using an FTP program, upload the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins folder on your site. Then go to the Plugins screen and you can find your new plugin in the list. Click ‘Activate’ to get started. 

## More Plugins Menu Options 

On the **Installed Plugins** page, you’ll also see a list of all the plugins currently installed on your WordPress site. Some plugins come bundled with your WordPress installation, like Akismet, a plugin that protects your blog from comment and trackback spam, and Jetpack, a way to connect your blog to a WordPress.com account and activate additional features. 

The last menu item beneath Plugins in the WordPress dashboard is the **Editor**. The built-in WordPress plugin editor can be used to make changes to any of your plugins’ individual PHP files. Just be aware that if you make changes, plugin updates will overwrite your customizations. So, unless you know PHP, you probably won’t want to edit any of your plugin’s PHP code.
