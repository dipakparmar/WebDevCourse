## Logging Into Your New WordPress Site

Once WordPress has been installed on
your web server, you can access your
WordPress login page from two
different URLs.

### Your WordPress Login URL
The first way to access your WordPress Login URL will be in this format:

```
http://yoursite.com/wp-login.php
```

You can also log in from:

```
http://yoursite.com/wp-admin
```

For example, for a new WordPress installation, you can visit yoursite.com/wp-login.php or yoursite.com/wp-admin to login. It might be helpful if you bookmark your site’s login URL.

From your WordPress login screen, you’ll enter the username and password that you set up during the WordPress installation process. If you’ve forgotten your WordPress login password, you can click the “Lost Your password?” link to retrieve it via email.
