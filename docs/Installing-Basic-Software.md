> In _Installing basic software_ , we show you what tools you need to do simple web development, and how to install them properly.

## What tools do the professionals use?

*   **A computer**. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are reading this article on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer running Windows, Mac, or Linux.
*   **A text editor**, to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), or a hybrid editor (e.g. [Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.
*   **Web browsers**, to test code in. Currently, the most-used browsers are [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge). You should also test how your site performs on mobile devices and on any old browsers your target audience may still be using (such as IE 8–10.)
*   **A graphics editor**, like [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/), or [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), to make images for your web pages.
*   **A version control system**, to manage files on servers, collaborate on a project with a team, share code and assets, and avoid editing conflicts. Right now [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is the most popular version control system and the [GitHub](https://github.com/) code hosting service, based on [Git](http://git-scm.com/), is also very popular.
*   **An FTP program**, used on older web hosting accounts to manage files on servers ([Git](http://git-scm.com/) is increasingly replacing FTP for this purpose). There are loads of (S)FTP programs available including [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [Fetch](http://fetchsoftworks.com/), and [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
*   **An automation system,** like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests.
*   Templates, libraries, frameworks, etc., to speed up writing common functionality.
*   More tools besides!


## What tools do I actually need, right now?

That looks like a scary list, but fortunately, you can get started in web development without knowing anything about most of these. In this article, we'll just set you up with a bare minimum — a text editor and some modern web browsers.

### Installing a text editor

You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) and macOS comes with [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit). Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with [gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit) by default.

For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting out with [Brackets](http://brackets.io), which is a free editor that offers live previews and code hints.

### Installing modern web browsers

For now, we'll just install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click the relevant links to download installers for your favorite browsers:

* Linux: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).
* Windows: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (Windows 10 comes with Edge by default; if you have Windows 7 or above, you can install Internet Explorer 11; otherwise, you should install an alternative browser)
* Mac: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (Safari comes with iOS and macOS by default)

Before going on, you should install at least two of these browsers and have them ready for testing.

### Installing a local web server

Some examples will need to be run by a web server to work successfully. You can find out how to do this in [How do you set up a local testing server?](../docs/Setup-Web-Server.html)
